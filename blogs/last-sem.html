            <!-- introduction -->
            <p>
                my last semester at iiitd has been a whirlwind of research, coursework, and personal growth. 
                here's a reflection on the experiences, challenges, and learnings from this transformative period.

            <p>
                working at the translational biology lab under dr. jaspreet kaur dhanjal has been an incredible experience.
                from diving deep into bioinformatics to working on my first publication, this journey has shaped my
                understanding of interdisciplinary research.
